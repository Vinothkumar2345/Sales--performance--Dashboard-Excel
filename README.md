#  **Objective :**

  The objective of this Sales Performance Dashboard project was to enhance my proficiency in utilizing Excel's features for sales data analysis and visualization. Through this project, I aimed to improve my skills to organize and manipulate data perform calculation and analysis , and create visual representation of data using charts and graphs .

    
# **Data  gathering and cleaning :**

•	Collect sales data from multiple sources such as CRM systems, sales databases, Excel files, or third-party APIs to consolidate performance data.

•	Combine data from different departments (e.g., sales, marketing, finance) and platforms to create a unified dataset for analysis.

•	Ensure the accuracy and consistency of sales data by checking for duplicate records, erroneous entries, and missing values.

•	Address any missing sales data points by imputing values based on historical trends, removing rows with missing data, or flagging them for further investigation.

•	Standardize columns such as sales dates, products , and currency formats to ensure uniformity across the dataset for accurate analysis.

•	Correct any inconsistencies in date formats (e.g., day-month-year vs. month-day-year) and handle time-based data to enable accurate trend analysis.

•	Calculate derived metrics like total revenue, units sold, or sales growth by transforming the raw data into more meaningful fields for analysis.

•	Group data by key dimensions such as region, salesperson, product category, or time period to facilitate easy comparison and trend analysis.


 # **Data Processing :**

•	Aggregate individual sales records into summary data, such as monthly, quarterly, or yearly sales totals, average revenue, and total units sold, for clearer performance insights.

•	Apply calculations to derive key metrics such as sales growth, profit margins, and conversion rates, transforming raw data into actionable information.

•	Process time-based data (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly sales) to identify trends and seasonality, enabling accurate trend analysis and forecasting.

•	Identify and handle missing or inconsistent data points through imputation, removal, or flagging, and address outliers to prevent distortion in analysis.

•	Organize and format data to be compatible with dashboard tools, ensuring proper column names, consistent units, and structured data that is easy to visualize in charts and graphs.


# **Conclusion :**

   In conclusion, the data processing steps for the Sales Performance Dashboard have been essential in transforming raw sales data into meaningful insights. By aggregating sales figures, applying necessary transformations, and processing time-series data, we were able to identify key trends and performance metrics. Handling missing data and outliers ensured the integrity and accuracy of the analysis, while careful formatting of the data made it ready for effective visualization. These steps have collectively enabled the creation of a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights, helping to monitor and improve sales performance over time.
